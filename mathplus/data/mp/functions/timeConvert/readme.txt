Designed to convert ticks into human-readable time
Author: Cosmelon

const.mcfunction initializes the constants used for both math functions
equiv.mcfunction takes +tickInput and outputs it in its equivalent minute, second, and millisecond values.
    NOTE: Due to the limitation that scoreboards use int data type instead of float, these numbers are rounded to the nearest whole
convert.mcfunction takes +tickInput and converts it to a human-readable time format
