Sorted leaderboard for players. Sorts from position 1 through 5

Players with the highest score are given lb_p1
    lowest are given lb_p5

Scores for the formula are grabbed from the objective mp_lb -- math is done on mp_indiv

I tried to structure the formula to be tilable, let me know in an issue if that becomes a problem!
